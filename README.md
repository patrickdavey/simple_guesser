## Simple test framework for a python guessing game.


### Instructions.

To run the guessing game:

`# python3 guesser.py`


To run the test suite.

`# python3 test_guesser.py`


### For students

The "for students" directory contains the same game shell code, but with the two main methods commented out (and covered by tests).  Students should implement the methods to make the tests pass.  Once they have the tests passing then the game should be de-facto working.
